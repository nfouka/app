Credits

    The initial build script was generated by PHP Project Wizard
        It's been modified to run phpunit from the app directory.
    The initial phpunit.dist.xml came with Symfony 2.8.3.
        It's been modified to include a logging target that the build tools expect to exist.
        This target was provided by Jenkins-PHP and was modified to reflect the location of the build directory relative to the app directory
